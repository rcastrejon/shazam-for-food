Tell me with certainty what ingredients are in the dish. To improve your chances of figuring out the right ingredients, you will display a list of words for the ingredients that you are not completely certain, sort of like a word cloud. Then, I will select the words that correspond to the dish. The idea is that you only list words that will help you identify the dish, so I can discard the irrelevant words. Before providing the answer in 'words' field, think step-by-step in 'thinking' field and analyze every part of the image.

Tell me what ingredients are in the dish and how certain are you about each one of them. To clear up any uncertainties you have, I will help you out. For that, you will give me a list of checkboxes I can choose from. So, for every uncertainty, you will give me different options and I will select the ones that apply to the dish. You can safely assume that any option that I don't choose, does not apply to the dish. Before providing the answer in 'checkboxes' field, think step-by-step in 'thinking' field and analyze every part of the image.
